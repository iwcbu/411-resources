(* Going to be honest, I couldn't figure out this one because when I put the 
container into its unresponsive state, I couldn't do any commands on the console lines.
So instead I just did docker ps from a new terminal window and of course because the
docker's container is locally stored, it can still observe it. Anyway I couldn't get (Unresponsive)
to show up and Ive been waiting for a bit.
